# ðŸŽµ Music Archive (Work in Progress)

## Overview

Displays artists grouped by year with embedded Spotify links to tracks or albums for convenience.

You can add songs yourself, or search by year, artist, or title of a track/album â€” the list filters accordingly.

## Usage

1. **Download** the [`songs.json`](./songs.json) file containing the current list of songs to a folder on your computer.
2. **Import** the JSON file in the app to load the existing songs.
3. **Add songs** as you like.
4. **Export** your updated list to save changes as a JSON file. Feel free to push a new **songs.json** file with any new songs if you like!
